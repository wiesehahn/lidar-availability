## Lidar availability - Lower Saxony

Unfortunately ALS data in Lower Saxony is still not available as open data. However, there is a contract which makes the data available to th NW-FVA for research purposes. 
First data is available for the year 2010 and since then there have been regular updates from year to year. @fig-als-lower-saxony-year provides an overview on the year of data acquisition in Lower Saxony by region. A constantly updated version is also available from LGLN from [lgln.niedersachsen.de](https://cms.lgln.niedersachsen.de/fb24/dgm1_dom1.pdf).

Since one of the main porpuses of ALS data was originally (and still is) the creation of digital terrain models, data is usually collected outside of the vegetation period (leaf-off) to yield a higher penetration rate to the ground. However, the exact date of the flight within each year varies with each campaign.  @fig-als-lower-saxony-month provides an overview on the month in which the data was collected.

Since 2020 the first regions had a repeated coverage of ALS data. When, how and where areas will be covered by new campaigns remains unclear, as there is no public information on these plans. According to the [DTM quality standard](https://www.adv-online.de/AdV-Produkte/Standards-und-Produktblaetter/Standards-der-Geotopographie/binarywriterservlet?imgUid=2b14073e-de6b-1f71-96e7-436303dd7d12&uBasVariant=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111) there has to be a timeliness of less than 10 years for terrain models, however personal information suggests that additional data is assessed based on the financial scope.
